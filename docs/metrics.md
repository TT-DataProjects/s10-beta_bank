Would you like help choosing the right metrics for your algorithm? Let me share some tips with you! Here are several scoring metrics that are particularly useful depending on your specific goals and the nature of this classification problem:

## Summary

- **If you prioritize overall balance**: Use **Balanced Accuracy** or **MCC**.
- **If you focus on positive cases**: Try **F2 Score** or **Precision-Recall AUC**.
- **If you care about minimizing false positives**: Use **Specificity**.
- **If you prefer a probabilistic approach**: Use **Log Loss**.

------
## Metrics

### 1. **Balanced Accuracy**

- **When to use**:

  - For imbalanced datasets where both classes' performance matters.

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Balances sensitivity (recall of the positive class) and specificity (recall of the negative class).

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score, make_scorer
  
  balanced_acc_scorer = make_scorer(balanced_accuracy_score)
  ```

------

### 2. **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**

- **When to use**:

  - For highly imbalanced datasets, where a single metric summarizing the confusion matrix is desirable.

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Accounts for true/false positives and true/false negatives, offering a balanced view.
  - MCC = 1 is perfect prediction; MCC = 0 is random guessing.

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import matthews_corrcoef, make_scorer
  
  mcc_scorer = make_scorer(matthews_corrcoef)
  ```

------

### 3. **Precision-Recall AUC (PR AUC)**

- **When to use**:

  - When the positive class is rare and recall is critical, but precision also matters.

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Focuses on the trade-off between precision and recall rather than overall accuracy.

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, auc, make_scorer
  
  def pr_auc_score(y_true, y_probs):
      precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_probs)
      return auc(recall, precision)
  
  pr_auc_scorer = make_scorer(pr_auc_score, needs_proba=True)
  ```

------

### 4. **F2 Score**

- **When to use**:

  - When recall is more important than precision (e.g., catching as many positive cases as possible is critical).

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Weighs recall more heavily than precision.

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, make_scorer
  
  f2_scorer = make_scorer(fbeta_score, beta=2, pos_label=1)
  ```

------

### 5. **Cohen's Kappa**

- **When to use**:

  - To measure agreement between predicted and actual labels, accounting for chance.

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Useful for highly imbalanced datasets where random guessing might otherwise appear artificially good.

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score, make_scorer
  
  kappa_scorer = make_scorer(cohen_kappa_score)
  ```

------

### 6. **G-Mean**

- **When to use**:

  - When you need to balance sensitivity and specificity in an imbalanced dataset.

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Maximizes the true positive rate and minimizes the false positive rate.

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from imblearn.metrics import geometric_mean_score, make_scorer
  
  gmean_scorer = make_scorer(geometric_mean_score)
  ```

------

### 7. **Log Loss**

- **When to use**:

  - For probabilistic models where calibrated probabilities are important.

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Penalizes incorrect confident predictions more than near-miss errors.

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import log_loss, make_scorer
  
  log_loss_scorer = make_scorer(log_loss, greater_is_better=False, needs_proba=True)
  ```

------

### 8. **Specificity (True Negative Rate)**

- **When to use**:

  - When minimizing false positives is critical.

- **Why it's useful**:

  - Measures how well the model identifies the negative class.

- **Implementation**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import recall_score, make_scorer
  
  specificity_scorer = make_scorer(recall_score, pos_label=0)
  ```
